Wes, here are the thoughts we had over Functions and Subroutines, please implement what you feel is needed, and let us know what you need help with:

All function variables should have the same name as their main program counterparts for simplicity.

All variables that are passed into any function should be declared as global variables, so that the methods can modify them.

We were thinking that a two-pass system may work better, on the first pass through the fortran code, identify the global variables, and assemble a list, and then on the second begin working with the code, declaring global variables up-front and others normally.

Alternative Option: Declare all variables as global, at least for this deliverable, and fix it to be more elegant on the next deliverable.
